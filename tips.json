        "content": "Using 'const' and 'let' helps avoid common pitfalls associated with variable scoping in JavaScript. 'const' is used for variables that should not be reassigned, providing more predictable and maintainable code. 'let' is used for variables that can change, but it is block-scoped, reducing the chances of bugs related to variable hoisting.
