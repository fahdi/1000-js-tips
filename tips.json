        "summary": "Use 'const' and 'let' instead of 'var'",
        "content": "Using 'const' and 'let' helps avoid common pitfalls associated with variable scoping in JavaScript. 'const' is used for variables that should not be reassigned, providing more predictable and maintainable code. 'let' is used for variables that can change, but it is block-scoped, reducing the chances of bugs related to variable hoisting."

        "summary": "Sanitize User Input",
        "content": "Always sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and command injection. Use libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content, and ensure that any data coming from user input is properly validated and sanitized before being processed or displayed."

        "summary": "Use Promises and Async/Await for Asynchronous Code",
        "content": "Promises and async/await provide a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions. They help in writing more maintainable code and reduce the complexity associated with error handling in asynchronous operations."

        "summary": "Avoid Global Variables",
        "content": "Global variables can lead to conflicts and hard-to-debug issues, especially in larger codebases. Encapsulate your code within functions or use module patterns to avoid polluting the global namespace. This practice helps in maintaining code modularity and reusability."

        "summary": "Optimize DOM Manipulation",
        "content": "Frequent DOM manipulation can lead to performance issues. To optimize, batch DOM changes, use document fragments, or leverage virtual DOM libraries like React. Minimizing reflows and repaints by reducing direct DOM interactions can significantly improve performance."

        "summary": "Debounce and Throttle Events",
        "content": "For events that fire frequently (like scroll, resize, or keypress), use debounce or throttle techniques to limit the number of times the event handler executes. This helps in improving performance and preventing excessive function calls. Libraries like Lodash provide convenient debounce and throttle methods."

        "summary": "Use Strict Mode",
        "content": "Enable strict mode by adding 'use strict'; at the beginning of your JavaScript files or functions. Strict mode helps in catching common coding errors, prevents the use of certain problematic features, and provides better performance by allowing JavaScript engines to optimize code more effectively."

        "content": "Browser DevTools are powerful tools for debugging, profiling, and optimizing your code. Use features like breakpoints, network analysis, and performance profiling to identify and fix issues more efficiently. Familiarizing yourself with DevTools can greatly enhance your development workflow."

        "summary": "Handle Errors Gracefully",
        "content": "Always include error handling in your code to manage potential issues gracefully. Use try/catch blocks for synchronous code and .catch() or async/await with try/catch for asynchronous code. Proper error handling ensures your application can recover from unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users."
