# 1000 JavaScript Tips

<details><summary>1. Use 'const' and 'let' instead of 'var'</summary>
Using 'const' and 'let' helps avoid common pitfalls associated with variable scoping in JavaScript. 'const' is used for variables that should not be reassigned, providing more predictable and maintainable code. 'let' is used for variables that can change, but it is block-scoped, reducing the chances of bugs related to variable hoisting. For more information, refer to the [MDN Web Docs on const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [MDN Web Docs on let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let).
</details>

<details><summary>2. Sanitize User Input</summary>
Always sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and command injection. Use libraries like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) for sanitizing HTML content, and ensure that any data coming from user input is properly validated and sanitized before being processed or displayed. Learn more about XSS prevention on the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
</details>

<details><summary>3. Use Promises and Async/Await for Asynchronous Code</summary>
Promises and async/await provide a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions. They help in writing more maintainable code and reduce the complexity associated with error handling in asynchronous operations. Learn more about [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) on MDN Web Docs.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Avoid Global Variables</summary>
Global variables can lead to conflicts and hard-to-debug issues, especially in larger codebases. Encapsulate your code within functions or use module patterns to avoid polluting the global namespace. This practice helps in maintaining code modularity and reusability. Read more about best practices in the [MDN Web Docs on Variable Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variable_scope).
</details>

<details><summary>5. Optimize DOM Manipulation</summary>
Frequent DOM manipulation can lead to performance issues. To optimize, batch DOM changes, use document fragments, or leverage virtual DOM libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/). Minimizing reflows and repaints by reducing direct DOM interactions can significantly improve performance. Check out this [article on DOM manipulation performance](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/).
</details>

<details><summary>6. Debounce and Throttle Events</summary>
For events that fire frequently (like scroll, resize, or keypress), use debounce or throttle techniques to limit the number of times the event handler executes. This helps in improving performance and preventing excessive function calls. Libraries like [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce) provide convenient debounce and throttle methods.

</details>

<details><summary>187. Use `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, and `Object.entries`</summary>
These methods are useful for converting an object's keys, values, or entries into arrays. They are helpful for iterating over properties. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values), and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries).
</details>

<details><summary>188. Use the `in` Operator for Property Checking</summary>
The `in` operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain. It's useful for checking if an object has a property. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in).
</details>

<details><summary>189. Understand `instanceof` for Type Checking</summary>
The `instanceof` operator tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. It's useful for checking the type of an object. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof).
</details>

<details><summary>190. Use `Function.prototype.bind` for Explicit `this` Binding</summary>
The `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. It's useful for ensuring `this` is correctly set. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind).
</details>

<details><summary>191. Use `Function.prototype.call` and `apply`</summary>
The `call` and `apply` methods call a function with a given `this` value and arguments. `call` accepts an argument list, while `apply` accepts a single array of arguments. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply).
</details>

<details><summary>192. Use `document.createElement` for Dynamic Elements</summary>
The `document.createElement` method creates an HTML element specified by tagName. It's useful for creating elements dynamically. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).
</details>

<details><summary>193. Use `element.append`, `prepend`, `before`, and `after`</summary>
These methods allow you to insert elements relative to an existing element, providing a more flexible way to manage the DOM. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).
</details>

<details><summary>194. Use `element.innerHTML` vs `element.textContent`</summary>
`innerHTML` sets or gets the HTML or XML markup contained within an element, while `textContent` sets or gets the text content. Use `textContent` to avoid security risks with user-generated content. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent).
</details>

<details><summary>195. Understand Event Capturing and Bubbling</summary>
Event capturing and bubbling are phases in the event propagation process. Capturing occurs first, moving from the outermost element to the target element, followed by bubbling, which moves back up. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/eventPhase).
</details>

<details><summary>196. Use `event.preventDefault` and `event.stopPropagation`</summary>
`event.preventDefault` cancels the event if it is cancelable, preventing the default action. `event.stopPropagation` prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation).
</details>

<details><summary>197. Use `try...catch` for Error Handling</summary>
The `try...catch` statement allows you to handle exceptions that occur in your code, improving error management and debugging. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch).
</details>

<details><summary>198. Use `finally` with `try...catch`</summary>
The `finally` block contains statements to execute after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It's useful for cleanup code. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#the_finally_block).
</details>

<details><summary>199. Use Custom Errors for Better Debugging</summary>
Custom errors can provide more meaningful error messages and debugging information. Create a custom error by extending the built-in Error class. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#Custom_Error_Types).
</details>

<details><summary>200. Use ES6 Modules for Better Code Organization</summary>
ES6 modules allow you to import and export functions, objects, and primitives from one module to another, promoting better code organization and reuse. Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
